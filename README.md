Aerial Lockscreen (WAM Project)

Version: v1.0 – First Release (Buggy / Experimental)

This is the very first version of the Aerial Lockscreen from the WAM project, which brings macOS-style features to Windows. Please note that this release is still experimental and may contain bugs.

⚙️ How to Use
Set up Startup
Place lockscreen.exe to run on Windows startup.
Configure Settings
Open settings.exe to configure:
Password
Background image
Aerial video (must be .mp4)
⚠️ If you have a .mov file, you can force the extension to .mp4 since the program only reads .mp4.

Important
Do not open lockscreen.exe before setting a password in settings.exe.
After setting everything up, you can add the lockscreen to My Dock Finder.
You will also find an icon in Launchpad inside the folder, in case you want to launch it manually (not only at startup).
